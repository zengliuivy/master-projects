<!--
**zengliuivy/master-projects** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

file 'track initiation':
This is an implementation of the track initiation proposed in:
Zeng, L., Xiao, G., Ding, C. et al. Track initiation based on adaptive gates and fuzzy Hough transform. SIViP 17, 4057â€“4065 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11760-023-02637-5

This file contains a GUI interface: initiation.mlapp
The main simulation function : track_initiation_simulation.m
The function that draws the image is:picture.m

The folder 'method_compared' contains other algorithms compared in the paper (in the same simulation environment)
The folder 'track_initiation' contains source files (latex) of this paper.

file 'track filter':
This file contains a GUI interface:hangjixianshi.fig and hangjixianshi.m
based on an implementation of the adaptive GLMB filter proposed in:
```
